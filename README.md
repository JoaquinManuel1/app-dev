## A short summerization of the current setting by me
- In a galaxy far in the future where the whole milky way are in chaotic conflict where every faction is trying to destroy another faction, but everyone agrees on destroying the bugs (aka tyranids) when they appear while they fight each other. 
>The human who ones dominated the whole galaxy for 10k years or so have now devolved into a radical religous cult who worships a god of mankind, who he did not wanna be worshipped as one, while having his sons fix his mess for not being a good father to them. 

>The eldar who once were a powerful race now trying to get a way to stop a pleasure god known as slanesh (he/she who thirst) due to the fact when one of them dies without their soul stone their soul will be delivered straight to slanesh the chaos gods. 

>Chaos, a place basically hell but amped out to oblivioun where suffering is quite literally everywhere and everyone suffers one way or another, the only ones who benefit when worshipping the chaos gods are the gods themselves. There are 4 of the main big ones: 
1. *Tzentch* a god representing cunning, intellegence, and tricks (aka betraying), he sometimes turn you into a hideous being for the fun of it. 
2. There's *Nurgle* which is god of life and disease, when worshipping him he pretty much turns you into an ugly monster, like really ugly but you do become happy and feel no pain. 
3. *Khorne* god of war, his honarable and loves fighting but you will start to loose your mind slowly, it turns you into a bloodthirsting brute that knows no end in fights. 
4. Then there's *Slaanesh* aka pleasure god, don't think this is a good pick since you will turn into a insane degenerate that finds pleasure anyway you can like **ANYWAY** you can, its a slow but big spiral. 

>After chaos theres necrons, a bunch of old men who wants their galaxy back after waking up too early in the current settings with the highest tech that can destroy solar systems by tapping also they want organic bodies since they're were once organic being but now only robots. 

> There are orks here the only race that has fun in the setting as they only want to fight. They will literally die if they don't fight and also fun fact they're mushrooms so when they die, they will spew out spores that makes orks so that means once its in your planet, pretty much impossible to get rid of them.

###There are many more other factions but they are pretty much currently not that insanely active in the settings due to the fact GW(aka Game Worshops) don't wanna try finnishing a story due to profits and also their writers having a hard time cleaning up the mess what the other writers left for them. **THERE ARE A LOT OF PLOT HOLES** but still enjoyable and a very huge setting after retconning a lot of plotholes and rewriting a lot of stories to make more sense
